# Bug Fixes Session - Dec 11, 2024

## Issues Reported
1. **Blank results page** - queries complete but show nothing
2. **Query clears on refresh** - text disappears when page refreshes
3. **Cursor jumps to end** - can't type in middle of query

## Bug #1: Blank Results Page (INVESTIGATING)

**Symptoms:**
- With BYOK keys: Query submits, loading works, results page shows BLANK
- Without keys: "No keys" error, then query clears

**Possible causes:**
- SSE stream not parsed correctly
- Result object malformed
- State cleared during navigation
- `conversationHistory` reset unexpectedly

**Debug steps needed:**
1. Check browser Network tab - is `complete` event received with data?
2. Check console for errors
3. Add console.log in SSE handler to verify result structure

**Code locations to check:**
- `app/page.tsx:456-470` - SSE 'complete' event handler
- `src/components/ResultsView.tsx:155` - synthesis rendering
- `app/api/research/stream/route.ts:448` - where result is sent

## Bug #2: Query Clears on Refresh (FIXED)

**Root Cause:** `useBrowserHistory` hook used `window.history.pushState` which doesn't persist across refresh.

**Fix Applied:**
- `src/hooks/useBrowserHistory.ts`: Added `?q=` URL param in pushState
- `app/page.tsx`: Read `?q=` param on mount and restore query
- `app/page.tsx`: Call `pushState('research', { query: finalQuery })` when research starts

---

## Bug #3: Cursor Jumps to End (FIXED)

**Root Cause:** `useTransition` causes async state updates, losing cursor position.

**Fix Applied:**
- Removed `useTransition` from `setQuery` wrapper
- Removed `useTransition` from `setFollowUpQuery` wrapper
- Removed unused `useTransition` import

---

## Files Modified
- `src/hooks/useBrowserHistory.ts` - URL param persistence
- `app/page.tsx` - URL reading, removed useTransition
- `.env.local` - Added OPENROUTER_API_KEY

## Vercel Changes
- Added `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` to env vars
- Triggered redeploy (in progress)

---

## Next Steps
1. Debug blank results issue in browser
2. Complete cursor fix (remove remaining useTransition usage)
3. Run build, commit, push to dev
4. Test all fixes on test.eachie.ai
